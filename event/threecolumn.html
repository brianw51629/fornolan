											<h2>Competitive Teams</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Founded in 2022, We are on a mission to unite the esports industry's fragmented 
											data to power more engaging, live experiences for fantasy players, fans, streamers, teams 
											and event broadcasters around the world.
										</p>
										<p>
											Put simply, esports is competitive level gaming. It's teams of people playing games against 
											each other at a professional level, regularly winning huge sums of money as prizes. 
											These esports players are contracted to play for a variety of different organisations, much 
											like a football or basketball player would be.
										</p>
										<p>
											Playing video games can make students smarter and more employable across a wider spectrum of 
											careers including medical field, engineering, aviation, remote flying, computer sciences, and etc. 
											Esports can boost children strategic thinking, teamwork, communication, leadership, performance 
											skills and confidence building.
